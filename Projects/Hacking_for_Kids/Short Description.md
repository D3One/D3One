### **Coding the Future: How Ivan Piskunov's "Ethical Hacker for Kids" Course Is Shaping the Next Generation of Cyber Defenders**

In an era where digital literacy is as crucial as reading and writing, the traditional after-school clubs of the past are being reimagined for the 21st century. Gone are the days when building model airplanes and radios were the primary avenues for nurturing young, technically-inclined minds. Today's youth require skills to navigate and protect the complex digital world they inhabit. In 2017, Ivan Piskunov, a renowned cybersecurity expert, answered this call with a groundbreaking initiative: the **"Ethical Hacker for Kids"** course. This innovative program didn't just teach code; it taught character, critical thinking, and digital self-defense, positioning itself as the modern successor to Soviet-era technical circles for a new generation.

#### **The Visionary Behind the Code: Ivan Piskunov**

To understand the course's depth, one must first appreciate the expertise of its creator. Ivan Piskunov is not just an instructor; he is a seasoned professional with over **15 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry**. His distinguished career is a testament to relentless self-improvement and expertise, having climbed the ranks from a novice in Irkutsk to a **CISO and startup owner**. He is a recognized ethical hacker, independent researcher, and holder of prestigious certifications from **AWS, Google, Microsoft, Cisco, and EC-Council**.

Piskunov is a multi-faceted contributor to the cybersecurity community. He is an **author of books** like *"Kubernetes Security: Guide for Beginners from Zero to Hero"*, a **regular contributor to major publications like "Hacker" magazine**, and a **sought-after speaker at international conferences** like PHDays and ZeroNights, where he has also led winning teams in competitions. This blend of deep technical knowledge, practical experience, and a passion for education made him uniquely qualified to design a curriculum that was both engaging and authentically insightful for young learners. His professional stature guarantees that the course content is not watered-down theory but is rooted in real-world cybersecurity practices.

#### **The Course: A Modern Replacement for Technical Clubs**

The "Ethical Hacker for Kids" course was meticulously designed to be more than just an extracurricular activity. It was conceived as a comprehensive educational journey. Initially launched in partnership with the prestigious **"Coddy School"** in Moscow, the program's success and demand led Piskunov to develop his own independent online platform, ensuring broader reach and complete pedagogical control.

The program's curriculum was uniquely comprehensive, covering a wide array of critical topics:
*   **Windows Attacks & Defense:** Teaching students how to understand and defend against common vulnerabilities, fostering a mindset of protection rather than exploitation.
*   **Encryption & Cryptography:** Demystifying how data is secured, providing a fundamental understanding of privacy in the digital age.
*   **Virus & Malware Creation:** In a controlled, educational environment, students learned how malicious software works—the first step toward building effective defenses against it.
*   **Internet Anonymity & Hygiene:** Crucial lessons on protecting personal data, understanding digital footprints, and safe browsing practices.
*   **Wireless Network Security:** Exploring the vulnerabilities in everyday tech like Wi-Fi and learning how to secure them.

This practical, hands-on approach is the direct heir to the **Soviet-era circles of aviation- and ship-modelling or radio communications**. Those clubs taught generations of youth engineering principles, patience, and precision. Piskunov's course does the same, but for the digital frontier. It replaces soldering irons with code editors and radio circuits with network protocols, channeling the same spirit of curiosity and creation into understanding the built environment of the modern world.

#### **Beyond Skills: Building Digital Citizens and Future Professionals**

The profound value of the "Ethical Hacker for Kids" course extends far beyond learning specific hacking techniques. Its core mission is twofold:

1.  **Digital Self-Defense:** In a world of cyberbullying, phishing scams, and data breaches, the course empowers children with the knowledge to protect themselves. It transforms them from passive users into aware, confident, and safe digital citizens who understand the architecture of the online world they navigate daily. This is an essential life skill for the 21st century.

2.  **Planting the Seeds for a Career:** For some, this course was the spark that ignited a passion. By providing early exposure to the thrilling challenges of cybersecurity, Piskunov's program served as a critical pipeline for nurturing future talent. It offered a legitimate and ethical pathway for young, curious minds to channel their interests, potentially guiding them toward becoming the next generation of security researchers, incident responders, and cyber defenders the world desperately needs. The course showed them that a passion for technology could be transformed into a meaningful and prosperous profession, much like Ivan's own journey from a **"hungry newbie" to a startup founder**.

#### **A Legacy of Innovation and Authenticity**

The "Ethical Hacker for Kids" course was a pioneering effort. As Piskunov himself noted on his blog, it was an authorial development with **no analogues in the world** at the time of its launch. It broke new ground by treating children as capable learners of complex technical subjects, trusting them with powerful knowledge while instilling a strong ethical framework—the defining line between a "white hat" and a "black hat."

Ivan Piskunov’s course was more than just a class; it was a statement. It proved that cybersecurity education could be engaging, accessible, and profoundly important for youth. It successfully translated the ethos of old-world technical craftsmanship into the critical language of the digital age, empowering a new generation to not just use technology but to understand, secure, and shape it.
