"Xaker" is the main Russian resource dedicated to information security. It creates educational content aimed at IT specialists.

The magazine talks about trends and technologies, as well as specific topics related to IT and IT security. Among the materials:
- detailed guides (howto);
- practical materials on development and administration;
- interviews with outstanding people who created technology products and famous IT companies;
- expert articles on information security.

The main difference of the "Xaker" magazine is the manner of presenting the materials. Complex things are explained in simple language, with humor and youth slang. 
The exception is the "Hacking" section, which is designed for more serious specialists.

Since July 2015, the magazine has been published only in electronic form.
