## 11. **PE32 File Format: A Technical Deep Dive**

The Portable Executable (PE) format is the foundation of Windows executables, DLLs, and drivers. Understanding its structure is paramount.

### **11.1 DOS Header and the DOS Stub**
The file begins with the `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER`. Only two fields are critical for RE:
- `e_magic`: The famous "MZ" signature (`0x5A4D`).
- `e_lfanew`: The **4-byte offset** from the beginning of the file to the `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS`.

The DOS Stub is the legacy program that usually just prints "This program cannot be run in DOS mode".

**Practical Tip:** In a hex editor, you can quickly navigate to the NT Headers by going to offset `e_lfanew`.

### **11.2 NT Headers: The Heart of the PE File**
The `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` structure contains the `Signature` (`PE\0\0`) and two critical substructures:

*   **`IMAGE_FILE_HEADER` (`FileHeader`)**: Contains architectural info.
    *   `Machine`: `0x014C` for x86, `0x8664` for x64.
    *   `NumberOfSections`: The number of sections that follow. A sudden increase here can indicate packing.
    *   `TimeDateStamp`: The build timestamp. Can be faked (often set to `0` in malware).

*   **`IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER` (`OptionalHeader`)**: Despite its name, this is mandatory for executables.
    *   `AddressOfEntryPoint` (RVA): The address where execution begins. **This is the most important field for finding the OEP (Original Entry Point) of a packed binary.**
    *   `ImageBase`: The preferred base address where the file is loaded in memory (e.g., `0x00400000` for x86, `0x0000000100000000` for x64).
    *   `SectionAlignment`, `FileAlignment`: How sections are aligned in memory and on disk. Often manipulated by packers.
    *   `Subsystem`: `1` for native drivers, `2` for GUI, `3` for console.
    *   **Data Directories**: An array of 16 `IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY` structures. The most important for RE are:
        *   `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT` (Import Table)
        *   `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT` (Export Table)
        *   `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC` (Base Relocation Table)
        *   `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS` (Thread Local Storage)

### **11.3 Sections**
Sections contain the actual code, data, and resources. Common sections and their purposes:
*   `.text`: Executable code. Its characteristics include `IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE | IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE | IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ`.
*   `.rdata`: Read-only data (e.g., import/export info, hardcoded strings).
*   `.data`: Read/write initialized data.
*   `.idata`: Import address table (IAT). Often merged into `.rdata` or `.text` by linkers.
*   `.reloc`: Contains base relocations, allowing the binary to be loaded at an address other than `ImageBase`.
*   `.rsrc`: Resources (icons, dialogs, embedded files, manifests).

**Malware Twist:** Packers often create new, non-standard sections with names like `.UPX0`, `.Themida`, or `.vmp0`. The raw data in these sections is usually encrypted or compressed.

### **11.4 The Import Address Table (IAT)**
The IAT is a critical structure filled by the Windows Loader. It contains pointers to the actual API functions in memory.

**How it's built:**
1.  The PE file contains an **Import Directory** (pointed to by the `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT` data directory).
2.  This directory is an array of `IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR` structures, one for each DLL.
3.  Each descriptor points to two arrays of function names/ordinals: **OriginalFirstThunk** (Hint/Name Array) and **FirstThunk** (the IAT itself).
4.  On load, the loader walks the Hint/Name Array, resolves the function addresses, and writes them into the IAT array pointed to by `FirstThunk`.

**Practical RE Tip:** Packers often destroy the import directory to hinder analysis. The goal of unpacking is to let the packer reconstruct the IAT in memory, then dump it and fix the PE file using tools like **Scylla**.

## 12. **Windows Internals for Reverse Engineers**

### **12.1 The Process Environment Block (PEB)**
The PEB is a user-mode structure that contains vital information about the process. It's located at `fs:[0x30]` in x86 and `gs:[0x60]` in x64 Windows.

**Crucial PEB fields for Anti-Debugging:**
```c
typedef struct _PEB {
  BYTE Reserved1[2];
  BYTE BeingDebugged;        // Offset 0x2. IsDebuggerPresent() reads this.
  BYTE Reserved2[1];
  PVOID Reserved3[2];
  PPEB_LDR_DATA Ldr;         // Offset 0xC. Contains info about loaded modules.
  PRTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS ProcessParameters;
  PVOID Reserved4[3];
  PVOID AtlThunkSListPtr;
  PVOID Reserved5;
  ULONG Reserved6;
  PVOID Reserved7;
  ULONG Reserved8;
  ULONG AtlThunkSListPtr32;
  PVOID Reserved9[45];
  BYTE Reserved10[96];
  PPS_POST_PROCESS_INIT_ROUTINE PostProcessInitRoutine;
  BYTE Reserved11[128];
  PVOID Reserved12[1];
  ULONG SessionId;
} PEB;
```
**Assembly access:**
```asm
; x86 Assembly
mov eax, dword ptr fs:[0x30] ; EAX now points to the PEB
movzx ebx, byte ptr [eax+2]   ; EBX = PEB.BeingDebugged (0 or 1)

; Bypass: Patch this in memory to 0
mov byte ptr [eax+2], 0
```

### **12.2 The Thread Environment Block (TEB)**
Located at `fs:[0x18]` in x86. Contains information about the current thread, including a pointer to the PEB at offset `0x30`.
```asm
mov eax, dword ptr fs:[0x18] ; EAX points to TEB
mov ebx, dword ptr [eax+0x30] ; EBX points to PEB
```

---

## 13. **Anti-Debugging: Technical Bypasses**

### **13.1 API-based Checks**
*   **`IsDebuggerPresent()`**: Simply reads `PEB.BeingDebugged`.
    *   **Bypass:** Hardware breakpoint on `PEB.BeingDebugged` or patch the function in memory to always return `0`.
*   **`CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent()`**: Checks for a debugger on another process. Often used alongside `OpenProcess` on `CSRSS.EXE`.
*   **`NtQueryInformationProcess()`**: The powerhouse of debugger detection.
    *   `ProcessDebugPort` (`0x7`): Queries the debugger port. Returns `0` if not debugged.
    *   `ProcessDebugFlags` (`0x1F`): Returns a value indicating if debugging is allowed.
    *   `ProcessDebugObjectHandle` (`0x1E`): Checks for the existence of a debug object.
    *   **Bypass:** Hook `NtQueryInformationProcess` and return safe values for these classes.

### **13.2 Manual Code Checks and Patching**
Malware often implements checks manually.

**Example 1: Direct PEB Check**
```asm
call $+5                 ; A trick to get the current EIP
pop eax
mov ebx, eax
and ebx, 0FFFF0000h      ; EBX ~= base of current module
mov eax, [ebx + 3Ch]     ; EAX = PE header offset (e_lfanew)
mov edx, [ebx+eax+34h]   ; EDX = ImageBase
mov eax, [edx+30h]       ; EAX = PEB (fs:[0x30] points to PEB)
cmp byte ptr [eax+2], 0  ; Compare PEB.BeingDebugged with 0
jne DebuggerFound
```
**Bypass:** Find this code in your disassembler, and patch the `jne` instruction to `jmp` (opcode `0x75` to `0xEB`) or a `nop` (`0x90`).

**Example 2: TLS Callbacks**
Execution can start in `TLS Callbacks` before the main Entry Point. *Always check for them in the `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS` data directory*, as they often contain anti-debugging code.

---

## 14. **Practical Debugging Techniques with x64dbg/x86dbg**

### **14.1 Scripting and Conditional Breakpoints**
Use conditional breaks to avoid triggering anti-debugging.

*   **Break on `IsDebuggerPresent` return:** Set a breakpoint on the `ret` instruction of `IsDebuggerPresent` and set a condition like `eax==1` to catch only when a debugger is detected.
*   **Scripted bypass:** Use the built-in command box or scripting to automate patches.
    ```
    bp kernelbase!IsDebuggerPresent "seteax(0); ret;"
    ```
    This command sets a breakpoint that, when hit, sets EAX to 0 and immediately returns.

### **14.2 Finding the OEP in a Packed Binary**
1.  **Step 1: The ESP Trick.** Set a hardware breakpoint on access to the stack pointer after the packer unpacks itself.
    *   Let the binary run once until it breaks on the entry point (which is the packer stub).
    *   `F7` (Step Into) once. The stack pointer (`ESP`) will now point to a valid address.
    *   Right-click on `ESP` in the CPU register window -> **Hardware Breakpoint -> On Access -> Dword**.
    *   Press `F9` (Run). The debugger will break when the packer tries to return to the original unpacked code, right at the OEP.

2.  **Step 2: Recognize the OEP.** A common OEP pattern for MSVC compiled binaries:
    ```asm
    push ebp            ; Standard function prologue
    mov ebp, esp
    push -1             ; Typical startup sequence
    push <some_value>
    push <some_value>
    mov eax, dword ptr [FS:00000000h]
    push eax
    sub esp, 0C8h       ; Allocating space for local variables
    ; ... more initialization
    ```

## 15. **IDA Pro: Power Features and Scripting**

### **5.1 IDC and IDAPython Scripts**
Automate tedious tasks.

**Example: Renaming API Imports**
If the IAT is resolved, you can run a script to name all the import stubs.
```python
import idautils
import idc

for seg in Segments():
    if SegName(seg) == ".idata": # Look in the import section
        for ea in range(seg, SegEnd(seg)):
            if isCode(GetFlags(ea)):
                mnem = GetMnem(ea)
                if mnem == "jmp":
                    op = GetOperandValue(ea, 0) # Get the address it jumps to
                    name = GetFunctionName(op)   # Get the name at that address
                    if name and "sub_" not in name:
                        idc.set_name(ea, "imp_" + name, SN_NOWARN) # Rename the jmp stub
```

### **15.2 Structure Usage**
Define structures (like PEB, TEB, `_IMAGE_NT_HEADERS`) in the **Structures window** (`Shift+F9`). Then, you can apply them to hex data to make disassembly much more readable.

**Example: Applying the PEB structure:**
1.  Find a reference to `fs:[0x30]`.
2.  Hover over the register that holds the PEB address.
3.  Right-click -> **Structure offset** -> `PEB` -> `BeingDebugged` (offset `2`).

This will turn a cryptic line like `cmp byte ptr [eax+2], 0` into the self-documenting `cmp [eax+PEB.BeingDebugged], 0`.
