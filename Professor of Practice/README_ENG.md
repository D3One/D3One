Of course, my friend. I have analyzed the text from your README.md file and prepared a professional translation into American English. The translation maintains your original tone—confident, practical, and passionate—while adapting it for an international audience.


## **Ivan Piskunov | Professor of Practice in Cybersecurity**

**A practicing expert and evangelist in cybersecurity with 15 years of experience, dedicated to passing on living, applied knowledge to the new generation of specialists.**

My professional path is a consistent ascent from a technical specialist to a executive (CISO) and founder of my own startup. My expertise is focused on building security functions "from scratch," managing teams, investigating incidents, and developing defense strategies for major companies (such as Sberbank, Raiffeisenbank, MTS).

**My teaching journey began not in academia, but from real-world experience:**
*   **2013:** Began lecturing on information security at the Irkutsk State Linguistic University (ISLU, now MGLU) while working as an active practitioner.
*   **2017/2018:** Continued teaching activities at the Moscow Polytechnic University, sharing current industry cases with students.
*   My practical contribution and vision were recognized by university leadership: I **received invitations to assume the position of Head of Department (ISLU/MGLU) and Dean of the Faculty (Moscow Polytech)**, a rare occurrence for a specialist without formal academic titles.

**I am a Professor of Practice in the classic sense of the role:**
*   I do not hold advanced academic degrees (such as Candidate or Doctor of Sciences) or formal academic titles (such as Docent or Professor). My title is **"Practitioner."**
*   My competencies, knowledge, and right to teach are confirmed not by diplomas, but by **real achievements, career growth, successful projects, and recognition from the professional community**.
*   For me, teaching is not a job, but a **passion, a mission, and evangelism**. I teach what I have personally gone through and tested in practice, and I do it with a great desire to show all the beauty and complexity of the cybersecurity field.

**My authored works and publications:**

*   **Book:**  – Moscow: Alpina Publisher, 2020.
*   **Compilation of works:** ["Current Issues of Ensuring Information Security: Theory and Practice"](https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=1111). – Irkutsk: ISLU, 2020. – 195 p. (co-authored).
*   **Articles and methodological guides:** [Digital Hygiene and Personal Security in Internet Space](https://www.elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=11111), [Practical Guide to Security Audit](https://github.com/D3One/D3One/blob/main/Professor%20of%20Practice/Practical_Security_Audit_Guide.pdf) and others.

In this repository, I share materials I create for my courses: original methodological guides, lab assignments, tutorials, and presentations. My goal is to **bridge the gap between theory and reality**, preparing students for the tasks they will face from day one of their careers.
